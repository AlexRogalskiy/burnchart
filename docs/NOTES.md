##Notes

- *payment gateways* in Canada: [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/payment-gateways/canada), [Chargify](http://chargify.com/payment-gateways/) list; I get free processing on first $1000 with [Stripe](https://education.github.com/pack/offers)
- [credit card form](http://designmodo.com/ux-credit-card-payment-form/) ux from Designmodo or [here](https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/79914/screenshots/1048397/attachments/127794/payments_page.jpg).
- workers: using a free instance of IronWorker and assuming 5s runtime each time gives us a poll every 6 minutes. Zapier would poll every 15 minutes but already integrates Stripe and FB.
- $2.5 Node.js PaaS via Gandi with promo code `PAASLAUNCH-C50E-B077-A317`.

###Free Forever Business Plan (= Community Shareholder/Partners Plan)

I can't sell people on free membership, that is only a small incentive. But I can sell them on an app that does what they want. Have early access to features etc. If someone sees that my app can help them, why not tell me about it so I can make it happen? (their time is valuable)

I could also provide people with Assembly coins for each feedback session I've had with them, thus making them share in the profits. They are basically startup members with equity by being Product Developers.

To qualify, these people need to be businesses actively using the software. Thus being stand-in users for other such $ paying businesses.

Let me call you every 3 months to ask how you are doing, how you are using the software, what can I improve, and you will get 3 months usage for free. The idea is to keep in touch with the most loyal customers, to hear them say how great/shabby the app is. If they don't want to talk they can always pay for the Business Plan (most would pay or quit).

If someone stops using the app, send them an email asking them for a good time to call so I can make things right. They would get 3 months usage as well (that's like giving me a book for free that I dislike). It would be better to ask them what they were expecting and why we failed.
