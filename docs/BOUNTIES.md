#Bounties

Good bounties should assume that the reader as little context to the product as convenient (i.e. well known projects can assume readers know a little more).  

1.  Link to relevant Github repos
2.  Describe the problem
3.  List the goals
4.  List any blockers or subtasks
5.  Offer people to help out with it
6.  Preferably include images or supporting assets
7.  Mega bonus points for  quick video/screencast

Depending on the problem, go into more or less detail about the solution. (i.e. if it's an easy but time consuming solution, spec it out clearly. If it requires more creativity stress the goals rather than the solution)
